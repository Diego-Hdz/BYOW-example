        <li>Almost half of the world’s population, that’s 3.2 billion people, tuned in to the 2014 World Cup.</li>
        <li>Germany have only ever failed to make it past the group stages in the World Cup twice. Once back in 1938, then 80 years later at the 2018 World Cup where they crashed out defending their title in the groups with a crushing defeat at the hands of South Korea.</li>
        <li>Brazil also hold the record for the most wins in one tournament, winning 7 matches in the 2002 World Cup in South Korea/Japan. To put that into perspective, they won every game in the tournament that year. That’s all three Group games, their Round of Last 16 game, their Quarter Final game, Semi Final game, and then the Final match in order to win their 5th World Cup title.</li>
        <li>The fastest ever World Cup goal took place only 10.89 seconds after kick off and was scored by Hakan Sukur of Turkey against South Korea in 2002.</li>
        <li>Egyptian Goalkeeper, Essam El Hadary, is the oldest player to ever play in the World Cup at the age of 45, having played at the 2018 Russian World Cup. After saving Saudi Arabia’s Fahad Al Muwallad’s penalty in his last game he then became the oldest ever goalkeeper to save a penalty at the World Cup.</li>
