    <h4>Jules Rimet Trophy</h4>
    <p>From 1930 to 1970, the Jules Rimet Trophy was awarded to the World Cup winning team.
        It was originally simply known as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, but in 1946 it was renamed after the
        FIFA president Jules Rimet who set up the first tournament. In 1970, Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled them
        to keep the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983 and has never been recovered, apparently melted down
        by the thieves.</p>

    <h4>FIFA World Cup Trophy</h4>
    <p>After 1970, a new trophy, known as the FIFA World Cup Trophy, was designed. The experts of FIFA, coming from seven countries,
        evaluated the 53 presented models, finally opting for the work of the Italian designer Silvio Gazzaniga. The new trophy is 36
        cm (14.2 in) high, made of solid 18 carat (75%) gold and weighs 6.175 kg (13.6 lb). The base contains two layers of 
        semi-precious malachite while the bottom side of the trophy bears the engraved year and name of each FIFA World Cup winner since 
        1974. The description of the trophy by Gazzaniga was: "The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to 
        receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the 
        stirring moment of victory."</p>

        <p>This new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently. World Cup winners retain the trophy only until the post-match 
            celebration is finished. They are awarded a gold-plated replica rather than the solid gold original immediately afterwards.</p>
